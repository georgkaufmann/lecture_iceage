Master course tought at [Freie Universität Berlin](http://fu-berlin.de) in the 
**M.Sc. Geological Sciences** program.

## Course summary

This lecture introduces ice ages as a tool to examine the dynamical behaviour of both the Earth's surface and the Earth's interior.

- We discuss causes and consequences of global ice ages and discuss reconstructions of past ice sheets, 
depending of changes in the past and present climate.
- We use observations such as strand lines, GPS-determined uplift rates, the Earth's changing gravity field to 
describe the dynamical response of the Earth to ice-age cycles.
- We will develop a process-based understanding of the dynamical response of the Earth to changes in the ice-ocean mass balance.

## Course How-To

- You should follow the lectures, preferrably in consecutive order.
- In each lecture, we start with an overview, then as main part the self-learning lecture notes can be downloaded.
- Then, a practical part follows, which is often a link to a python page for simple programming exercises, or some homework.

## Lectures

The lecture series is compiled as handouts in **pdf** format:
